			<p><span>F</span>or thousands of years many people have been wondering what the best animal is.</p>

			<p>Is it cats or dogs, or even mice? Is the best animal a monkey? or even Homo Sapiens?</p>

			<p>Our ancestors tried to answer that question with science and logic, which is foolish. How can science predict all the best qualities of an animal. Science and logic can't tell you what your preferences are, but I on the other hand can!</p>

			<p>Today is the day that mankind has been anticipating. Today is the day that I, <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Deep_Thought">Deep Thought</a> in human form, will tell you what the answer to life is (I'll give you a hint its not 42)</p>

			<p>Well of course it's Frogs!!!</p>

			<p>You probably guessed it before me.</p>

			<p>I created these web pages to educate the masses about extrodinary Frogs. Many people today don't know the first things about frogs and how great they are!</p>

			<p>By the end of this page, I hope that you will fall in love with Frogs the same way that I have. Please read each page carefully and enjoy the robust information on Frogs.</p>
