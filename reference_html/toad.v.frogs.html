			<p><span>I</span>n many peoples minds, Toads and Frogs are synonymous, however, the two families of animals could not be more different</p>

			<p>Toads and Frogs are part of the same evolutionary path, but they have many differences that make them distinguishable</p>

			<p>Some differences are: 
				<ol>
					<li>Toads don't live in the water</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Toads live near water, but they only use shallow water to breed, as they cannot swim. On the other hand, Frogs can swim and they spend most of their life in the water.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Frogs don't have teeth</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Toads don't require teeth because they rely on thier camouflage to surprise their prey and then swallow it whole.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Frogs have slippery and thin skin</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Since Toads live on land, they need thick skin to protect them from their surroundings.</li>
						</ul>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p class="section">There are also some internal differences</p>

			<p>For example, Toads of both sexes have a rudimentary ovary called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidder%27s_organ">Bidder's organ</a></p>

			<p>If you still don't understand the differences between them, I have created a cheatsheet for you.</p>

			<p>Below is a chart that will help you understand which animals are frogs and which animals are toads</p>
<!--
			<p><span>F</span>rogs are overhated because sometimes they make annoying sounds and they are wet and slimy. That's the simple truth. There are almost no other reasons to hate frogs.</p>

			<p>On this page I will debunk each of those reasons and show everyone that they are wrong</p>

			<p>Firstly, the people hating on frogs making sounds is ridiculous. Many things make annoying sounds like your brother and dog but you don't hate them, so stop hating frogs.<br>People are just bias and it needs to end now!!!</p>

			<p>Secondly, people dislike frogs because they are "nasty". This makes no sense because frogs are actually very clean creatures. They are usually in the water so it's impossible for them to be dirty and "nasty"</p>

			<p>The people perpetrating this belief are probably those who think that frogs and toads are the same animal. So for those people, I made a handy chart to explain their differences</p>
