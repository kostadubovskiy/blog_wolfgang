			<p><span>C</span>ontrary to popular belief, Frogs are great pets. If you take good care of them they can love you (exactly like dogs), but unlike dogs they don't constantly annoy you</p>

			<p>In this way they are very similar to Cats, but they don't have claws.</p>

			<p>However, unlike Cats and Dogs, they don't require a lot of resources to survive - they only need water and some food</p>

			<p>Not only are they easy to care for, they are also very fun animals to keep.</p>

			<p>They can be trained to do things like perhaps bake cookies</p>

			<p>Click <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-with-Your-African-Dwarf-Frog">here</a> to learn how to most effectively play with your Frog</p>

			<p>Frogs are very popular pets because of the reasons stated above. They are really cool and can jump start a childs love for animals.</p>

			<p class="section">As mentioned before, Frogs are easy to keep and fun animals. They are sold in almost every pet store. Below I have created a list to help you out.</p>

			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore">Petco</a></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Petco is the most well known petstores.</li>
						<li>It has the largest selection of Frogs.</li>
						<li>It also has lots of accessories for Frogs, if you already have one.</li>
					</ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.petsmart.com/">Petsmart</a></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Petsmart is another well known petstore.</li>
						<li>They have very little selection, at the time of looking, they only had one type of Frog in many retail locations and in some they had none.</li>
						<li>Additionally, their website is terrible, so I would only go to thier retail locations.</li>
					</ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.petsuppliesplus.com/">Pet Supplies Plus</a></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Pets Supplies Plus is another nationwide petstore.</li>
						<li>However, they have the poorest choice out of all the other stores I checked.</li>
						<li>I checked multiple retail locations and none of them had any Frogs</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Your Local Pet Shop</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Your local petshop might have some Frogs, but most likely they will not have anything Frog related</li>
					</ul>
			</ol>

			<p>If you decide to make a Frog your pet, you will be thrilled with the experience and definitly not disappointed</p>
