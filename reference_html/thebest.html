				<p><span>W</span>hen most people think of Frogs, they think of slimey creatures that make annoying sounds.</p>

				<p>Those people are right, but they're actually a very important animal to the environment and to the habitats they occupy.</p>

				<p>On top of eating annoying mosquitoes and flies, they're also a very important <a href="https://www.earthrangers.com/omg_animals/whats-so-great-about-frogs/#:~:text=Frogs%20are%20important%20to%20the,to%20keep%20the%20water%20clean.">indicator species</a></p>

				<p>Since Frogs have semi-permeable skin, Scientists usually look to Frogs to monitor the health of environments.</p>

				<p>If an environment is polluted or suffering, Frogs may have absorbed the toxins into thier bodies, which makes it easy for Scientists to track the problem down.</p>

				<p>Frogs are also amazing because they're among the most diverse animals on Earth - there are over 7,000 species of Frogs and more are being discovered every year!</p>

				<p class="section">Each species of Frog is different from the rest in some specific ways.</p>

				<p>Some cool species of Frogs include:
					<ol>
						<li><a href="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/goliath-frog#:~:text=Goliath%20frogs%20live%20in%20small,rocks%20to%20look%20for%20food.">The African Goliath Frog</a></li>
							<ul>
								<li>This Frog is the largest Frog in the world.</li>
								<li>The African Goliath tadpole is the same size as the average tadpole, but as an adult, it can grow to a foot long and can weigh over 7 pounds.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_rain_frog">The Desert Rain Frog</a></li>
							<ul>
								<li>This Frog just looks so funny.</li>
								<li>However, its behavior is also very interesting. It's native to the desert of Nambia which is already bizarre for a Frog as it's thousands of miles from any Fresh water.</li>
								<li>It's also a nocturnal animal and during the day it hides deep under the sand waiting for the night to come</li>
							</ul>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_frog">The Purple Frog</a></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Again this Frog looks very funny, and again it also has some interesting characteristics.</li>
								<li>It lives in India and only appears two weeks a year during the monsoon season.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/amphibians/facts/wallaces-flying-frog">The Wallace Flying Frog</a></li>
							<ul>
								<li>This Frog is one of the few Frogs that can "fly".</li>
								<li>They have an interesting membrane between their toes which allows them to get away from predators.</li>
								<li>When they are spooked they jump and spread their toes out which slows their fall and allows them to land.</li>
							</ul>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<p>Obvioulsy when there are almost 10,000 species of an animal, there are hundreds of fascinating ones. If you are interested in more cool frog species click <a href="moreinfo.html">here</a>.</p>

				<p><span>A</span> frog is a simple animal it eats and it sleeps.</p>

				<p>Unlike other animals Frogs don't try to do anything, its not living for us, its living for itself.</p>

				<p>For example let us consider cheetas - <br>Why does it run so fast. It doesn't have to. It's just showing off. Unlike Frogs, Cheetas are showoffs and nobody likes showoffs.<br>So, Frogs are better than Cheetas.<br>And by using that same logic we can conclude that Frogs are the best animals.</p>

				<p>Frogs are also the best animal because they eat flies and mosquitos. Even if you are a frog hater, you can agree that flies and mosquitos are much worse.</p>
